// In this we group method according to functionality or according to test process i.e regression or sanity.

//first we run the group which include sanity. Method 1,2,3,4 we execute. Method 4 because it contain sanity and also regression group tag.


//Then we create the second test under the xml file and provide the tag regression and run it again method 5,6  and 4 execute



// We have also use the before group method and after group method.
